          pilot training, he was assigned to VC-3 at Moffett Field near San
          Francisco, California </li>
        <li>1965: Lovell's first space flight, as pilot of Gemini 7. The
          flight's objective was to evaluate the effects on the crew and
          spacecraft from fourteen days in orbit</li>

        <li>1973: Lovell retires from the Navy and space program. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="bottom-quote"><em>"The lunar flights give you a correct
          perception of our existence. You look back at Earth from the moon, and
          you can put your thumb up to the window and hide the Earth behind your
          thumb. Everything you've ever known is behind your thumb, and that
          blue-and-white ball is orbiting a rather normal star, tucked away on
          the outer edge of a galaxy."
